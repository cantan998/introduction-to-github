# Weather Dashboard

This is a simple weather dashboard application that fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it using Python's `tkinter` library.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (install using `pip install requests`)
- An API key from OpenWeatherMap

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `weather_dashboard.py` file.
2. Install the required `requests` library using the following command:
   ```sh
   pip install requests
   ```
3. Replace `your_api_key_here` in the `weather_dashboard.py` file with your own OpenWeatherMap API key.
4. Run the `weather_dashboard.py` file using Python:
   ```sh
   python weather_dashboard.py
   ```

The application will display a graphical user interface where you can enter a city name and fetch the current weather data for that city.
